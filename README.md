# DOC's Lamps

Always wanted a bunch of better light sources that look more fashionable and technological than vanilla torches?
Well hello there, this mod is for you!

_This mod is WIP and probably won't ever be finished or released somewhere._
_Intended for personal use, but if you like it, you can always contribute._

Also, 1.12.2 is the latest version of the game.

## Screenshots

Texture are to be updated in the future. Probably. Hopefully.

## License

I don't even want to read Forge's license.

You can do _**whatever**_ you want with my models, textures, and code ~~(good luck with code lol)~~.
